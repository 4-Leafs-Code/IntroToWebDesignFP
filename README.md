This was my Summer22 Into. to Web Design final project.     
I updated the frunt end design of my Spring22 [Code Your Dreams final Project](https://github.com/4-Leafs-Code/CYD-Final-Project/).    
I wrote this site with HTML, CSS, BootStrap.     
    
Major changes from the CYD final project:    
* Removed the backend compleatly.   
* Removed User Accounts so there is no access login, profile, or Administrators pages.    
* Removed the News Letter page.   
    
The Code Your Dreams project would have been more of a fully functional site      
but this User interface is much nicer to view.
